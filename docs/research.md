    * Chromatic Aberration Correction
    * Distortion Scaling (Can be tweaked for various lenses)


## Arduino to Android communication
#### Via serial (usb)
  * Android Phone which supports USB Host Mode (i.e OTG Support) - Most devices running Android 3.1+ support this. Check if your phone does using the USB Host Diagnostics App from the Play Store.
  * Arduino - Any version will do. I will be using an Uno R3 .
  * Arduino USB Cable
  * [http://www.eagleg.com/micro-usb-otg-adapter-for-samsung-galaxy-s3.html?gclid=CjwKEAjw1_KwBRDEz_WvncL4jGwSJAAEym0d8K9lWRxKKIMLGRgZaFIKsTxzMgGZW89XdZunqstphhoCY0Dw_wcB](USB OTG Cable)  - You will need this to connect the USB cable of the Arduino to the micro-USB port of the  Smartphone. It costs about $5 on Amazon.
  * Android Studio - You will need to have this installed and setup. It is pretty easy to do that.  Android Studio makes app development easier with its predictions and code generation. It's one of the best IDEs out there. You could also follow this article to set up Android Studio on your computer.

#### Arduino + bluetooth module

#### LightBlue Bean

I have one in the lab that I have been testing with and the result is that the Android programmer crashes when I try to upload code. I can see the bluetooth uplink, but the programmer fails to upload with *unknown error*, which isn't very helpful. It seems to work better from iPad, but I don't have one to test with.
